                It has been sex weeks since Ján Kuciak was shot death with his fiancée in their newly bought house. The cold-blooded murder of only 27 year old investigative journalist was a painful slap across the face of democratic Europe. 
               <br><br> Especially, as Kuciak's death came only  couple of months after Daphne Caruana Galizia died in a car bomb. Coincidently, again close to her home. Both were uncovering political corruption in demcoratic and safe EU members countries.<br><br> This piece is looking into almost 2000 cases of journalist's death and showing worrying trend how reporters are more often endding up squarely in the way of organised crime, politics and crime, who do not hesitate to pull the trigger.

From 1789 journalists killed since 1992, most of them happened to catch last breath in Irak, Syria or Philippines.
<br><br> The reporters that died in their work are predominantly men. Female journalists that paid the ultimate price for their job make up only about 5 per cent.

                Strangely warzone reporters are not the ones who have it worae. Less than a third of deaths happen during a crossfire and even less during dangerous 
              assignments.Those are situations that were not supposed to turn violent initally, but escalated surprisingly, like for example violent protests or Kim Wall's visit to businessman's submarine.<br><br>
Essentially planned murder is the most common motive behind journalist's killings and it is purely connected to their work. In many cases reporters received death treats that authorities did not investigate promptly enough.

                And when talking about justice, police tend to fall short on catching the bad guys. Staggering number of journalist's murders end up without any conviction. In small portion of the cases, the perpetrators were caught but not the mastermind who ordered the killing.<br><br>Committee to Protect Journalists, that compiles the data used for this story, spotlights every year unflattering rankking of countries where journalists are slain and the killers go free. Getting away with number is most common in Somalia, Syria and Iraq.

              For a final analysis let's look who is truths biggest enemy. Most of the times as a suspect in murders come up a political groups (anti-government parties or combatants, including insurgents and terrorists), then civilian government officials, including police and organized crime, that usually is a pawn of influential people that need to hide their identity.
                <br><br>When we look into the topics that made people take actions to orchestrate a bloody silencing, predominantly the journalist's beats were politics, corruption and crime. There is a strong correlation between govermental or political's group involvement in a murder if the journalist's stories were mostly about politics and corruption.
